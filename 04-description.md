Radiotherapy has improved the prognosis for patients with Hodgkin disease (HD) dramatically in the last several decades. Unfortunately, the carcinogenic nature of radiotherapy has caused a significant increase in the risk of secondary malignancies in HD survivors. Second cancers are the leading cause of death among 15- year survivors of HD. Breast cancer is the most common solid tumor diagnosed in female survivors of HD and the risk varies with several patient and treatment-related factors. Recently, several groups have evaluated not only the incidence of breast cancer in female survivors of HD, but also the relation to the age at treatment, site treated, attained age, ovarian function, radiotherapy dose, and other treatment modalities used.The objective of this project is to further investigate the time interval to the development of breast cancer in women with HD treated with and without radiotherapy. In search for an adequate model for the data it is proposed to try a number of survival models, including cure models, and study the difference in breast-cancer- specific survival in patients who received radiotherapy as primary treatment vs. patients who did not.
