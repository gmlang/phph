                    Radiotherapy has improved the prognosis for patients with Hodgkin disease (HD) dramatically in the
                    last several decades. Unfortunately, the carcinogenic nature of radiotherapy has caused a significant
                    increase in the risk of secondary malignancies in HD survivors. Second cancers are the leading cause of
                    death among 15- year survivors of HD. Breast cancer is the most common solid tumor diagnosed in female
                    survivors of HD and the risk varies with several patient and treatment-related factors. Recently, several
                    groups have evaluated not only the incidence of breast cancer in female survivors of HD, but also the
                    relation to the age at treatment, site treated, attained age, ovarian function, radiotherapy dose, and
                    other treatment modalities used.

                    The objective of this project is to further investigate the time interval to the development of
                    breast cancer in women with HD treated with and without radiotherapy. In search for an adequate
                    model for the data it is proposed to try a number of survival models, including cure models, and
                    study the difference in breast-cancer- specific survival in patients who received radiotherapy as
                    primary treatment vs. patients who did not.
